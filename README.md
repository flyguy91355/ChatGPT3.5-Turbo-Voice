# ChatGPT3.5-Turbo-Voice
Python script that uses different libraries to perform speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and chatbot functionality using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API. The script listens for a wake-up word, and upon recognition, it initiates a conversation with the user using a chatbot. Add your API_KEY to line 30. Wake up name can be changed. This stays offline untill wake up word is recongnized. This way Google is not listening to your household conversation 24/7 like other programs do.
