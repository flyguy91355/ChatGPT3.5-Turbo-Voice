# ChatGPT3.5-Turbo-Voice
Python script that uses different libraries to perform speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and chatbot functionality using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API. The script listens for a wake-up word, and upon recognition, it initiates a conversation with the user using a chatbot. Add your openAI API_KEY to line 30. Wake up name (maria)can be changed, as can be the very realistic human female voice. This stays offline untill wake up word is recongnized. This way Google is not listening and recording to your household conversation 24/7 like other programs do.
